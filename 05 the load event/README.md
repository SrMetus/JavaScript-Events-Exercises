05 The load Event
It is a very good practice to wait for the browser to finish loading the page before starting the flow of your website/application, to do so, we use the LOAD event.

📝 Instructions:
Create a function called loadListener that listens to the load event and triggers an alert with the string "Loading finished..." when called.
💡 Hints:
The listener has to be assigned to the body.
