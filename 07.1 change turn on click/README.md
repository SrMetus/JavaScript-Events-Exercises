07.1 Change Turn on Click
Let's say that you want to create a turn-changer tool to switch turns between two players: Mario and Juan.

For that, we have created the global variable currentUser and stored the current player name in that variable, then updated the value of that variable every time the button is clicked to the other player's name.

📝 Instructions:
Change the code of the turnChanger function to add a third player called "Josh"
💡 Hint:
Add an else if condition asking for either Juan or Josh and change the value of currentUser variable accordingly.
