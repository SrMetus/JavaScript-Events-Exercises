07 Count onclick
If you have global variables, you can change their value during runtime using event handlers. For example, this code is increasing the value of the counter variable every time the user clicks on the Increase button.

📝 Instructions:
Create a decrease button with an event handler function. The function should decrease the counter variable and update the number on screen.
